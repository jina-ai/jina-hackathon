# Jina X Hackathon Support Repo

This repo has been put together by Jina for support during the Jina X Hackathon in September 2020.

**Note**: This repo is **not** a place for teams to host their projects. Teams should do that on their own repo!

## Key Features in a Project

Your project must have these to be considered for judgement:

### `requirements.txt`

All projects **must** have a `requirements.txt` that lists `jina` (all lower case), preferably with the version you are using (e.g. `jina==0.5.3`)
