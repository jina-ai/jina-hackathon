# Jina X Hackathon Support Repo

This repo has been put together by Jina for support during the Jina X Hackathon in September 2020.

**Note**: This repo is **not** a place for teams to host their projects. Teams should do that on their own repo!

## Key Features in a Project

Your project must have these to be considered for judgement:

### `requirements.txt`

All projects **must** have a `requirements.txt` that lists `jina` (all lower case), preferably with the version you are using (e.g. `jina==0.5.3`). (See the tip on `pip freeze` below)

## Tips

* [Work in a virtualenv](https://pythonbasics.org/virtualenv/) to stop your system-wide libraries affecting your hackathon project
* If you're using a virtualenv, [freeze your package list with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_freeze/) when you finish the project
